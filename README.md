## Features

- Compare two or more images.
- Multiple comparison modes. Highlight differences for finding small deviations in mostly identical images. Blend images for a better visual comparison.
- Align and rotate images directly in the application.
- Create screenshots and directly load them into the comparison. While Photocross is running press `Ctrl + Print Screen` to add a screenshot of the current application or press `Ctrl + Shift + Print Screen` to add a screenshot of the whole screen.
- Integrates with GNOME Files / Nautilus to select images for comparison directly from the context menu of your file manager.
